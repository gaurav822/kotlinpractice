/*
what is data encapsulation ?
Data encapsulation, also known as data hiding, is the mechanism
whereby the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from the user.

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield
that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

How to achieve ?
declaring class variables as private
providing setter and getters to modify and view variables
